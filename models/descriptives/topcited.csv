dimaggio 1991). in recent years, however, many high-status persons are far from being snobs and are eclectic, even ""omnivorous,"" in their tastes (peterson and simkus 1992). this suggests a qualitative shift in the basis for marking elite status - from snobbish exclusion to omnivorous appropriation. using comparable 1982 and 1992 surveys, we test for this hypothesized change in tastes. we confirm that highbrows are more omnivorous than others and that they have become increasingly omnivorous over time. regression analyses reveal that increasing ""omnivorousness "" is due both to cohort replacement and to changes over the 1980s among highbrows of all ages. we speculate that this shift from snob to omnivore relates to status-group politics influenced by changes in social structure, values, art-world dynamics, and generational conflict.",,,"abramson p.r., inglehart r., generational replacement and value change in eight west european countries, british journal of politics, 22, pp. 183-228, (1993);

reproductionist theorists have argued that schooling plays an important role in reproducing and even exacerbating existing disparities. but seasonal comparison research has shown that gaps in reading and math skills grow primarily during summer vacation, suggesting that non-school factors (e.g., family and neighborhood) are the main source of inequality. using the early childhood longitudinal study-kindergarten cohort of 1998-99, this article improves upon past seasonal estimates of school and non-school effects on cognitive skill gains. like past research, this study considers how socioeconomic and racial/ethnic gaps in skills change when school is in session versus when it is not. this study goes beyond past research, however, by examining the considerable inequality in learning that is not associated with socioeconomic status and race. this ""unexplained"" inequality is more than 90 percent of the total inequality in learning rates, and it is much smaller during school than during summer. the results suggest, therefore, that schools serve as important equalizers: nearly every gap grows faster during summer than during school. the black/white gap, however represents a conspicuous exception.",,,"allison p.d., missing data, (2002); blomqvist n., on the relation between change and initial value, journal of the american statistical association, 72, 360, pp. 746-749, (1977); bourdieu p., passeron j.-c., reproduction in education, society, and culture, (1977); bowles s., gintis h., schooling in capitalist america: educational reform and the contradictions of economic life, (1976); box g.e.p., cox d.r., an analysis of transformations, journal of the royal statistical society, 26, 2, pp. 211-252, (1964); burkam d.t., ready d.d., lee v.e., logerfo l.f., social class differences in summer learning between kindergarten and first grade: model specification and estimation, sociology of education, 77, pp. 1-31, (2004); coleman j.s., campbell e.q., hobson c.f., mcpartland j., mood a.m., weinfeld f.d., york r.l., equality of educational opportunity, (1966); collins r., the credential society: an historical sociology of education and stratification, (1979); condron d.j., roscigno v.j., disparities within: unequal spending and achievement in an urban school district, sociology of education, 76, pp. 18-36, (2003); cremin l., the american common school: an historic conception, (1951); dimaggio p., cultural capital and school success: the impact of status culture participation on the grades of u.s. high school students, american sociological review, 47, pp. 189-201, (1982); downey d.b., pribesh s., when race matters: student/teacher racial matching and teachers' evaluations of students' behavior, sociology of education, 77, pp. 267-282, (2004); entwisle d.r., alexander k.l., summer setback: race, poverty, school composition and math achievement in the first two years of school, american sociological review, 57, pp. 72-84, (1992); entwisle d.r., alexander k.l., the gender gap in math: its possible origins in neighborhood effects, american sociological review, 59, pp. 822-838, (1994); gamoran a., mare r.d., secondary school tracking and educational inequality: compensation, reinforcement, or neutrality?, american journal of sociology, 94, pp. 1146-1183, (1989); georgies a., explaining divergence in rates of learning and forgetting among first graders, (2003); hart b., risley t.r., meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young american children, (1995); heyns b., summer learning and the effects of schooling, (1978); heyns b., schooling and cognitive development: is there a season for learning?, child development, 58, pp. 1151-1160, (1987); hofferth s.l., sandberg j.f., how american children spend their time, journal of marriage and family, 63, pp. 295-308, (2001); karweit n., ricciuti a.e., summer learning: achievement profiles of prospects first graders, (1997); kuo h.-h.d., hauser r.m., how does size of sibship matter?

(ii) the interactions with others in the (youth training) field, related to the unequal resources different 'players' possess; and (iii) the location of decisions within the partly unpredictable pattern of turning-points and routines that make up the life course. this model avoids the twin pitfalls of implicit social determinism or of seeing (young) people as completely free agents.","economic and social research council, esrc","the study of training credits, upon which most of the theorising described above is based, was funded by the economic and social research council (esrc). we are grateful for their support, without which the study could not have been undertaken. we would also like to thank an increasingly large number of people who have given helpful critical feedback to our evolving thinking, including two anonymous reviewers. they are too numerous to name, and we hope they will accept this general acknowledgement.","alheit p., taking the knocks: youth unemployment and biography - a qualitative analysis, (1994);

[a]n account of class, rank or social hierarchy must be thin indeed unless accompanied by an account of the passions and sentiments that sustain it (william miller, the anatomy of disgust, p. 245). social identity lies in difference, and difference is asserted against what is closest, which represents the greatest threat (pierre bourdieu, distinction, p. 479). what we read as objective class divisions are produced and maintained by the middle class in the minutiae of everyday practice, as judgements of culture are put into effect (beverley skeggs, class, self, culture, p. 118).

the transformation of local economies and the local state; the changing nature of the corporate form; and the development of international regimes in a post-hegemonic world order. 4 the riots are the classical ati in regulatio and medieval latin gubernantia respectively and the etymologies refer to rule making and steering, piloting, or guidance. 5 the relevant norms in this context are norms of production and norms of consumption, with the focus of regulation being to secure their compatibility within a given accumulation regime (see especially aglietta 1979). the appropriateness of regularization or normalization is also indicated by the close links some commentators see between the regulation approach and recent french institutionalist work on the 'economy of conventions', with its marked emphasis on hermeneutic understanding of the bounded rationality of economic action grounded in socially embedded institutional rules and macro-economic diversity (on this, see, for example, dupuy eta1.1989; favereau 1994; orlcan 1994; salais and storper 1993). 6 the regulation approach is affiliated to the 'old' institutional and evolutionary economics (cf. mjaset 1985) as well as to classical marxism (cf. boyer 1990; lipietz 1985); and to the more general polanyian emphasis on the socially embedded, socially regulated character of economic activities (cf. polanyi 1944). 7 on the discursive constitution of problems, see jenson (1990); hay (this issue); jessop (1982,1990b). 8 this holds both for the now dominant parisian school and for the less celebrated grenoblois school. on these schools, see jessop (1990a). 9 among such critics we can mention bonefeld, clarke and holloway. for replies to them see jessop (1988); hay (1993). 10 this is especially marked in the work of waltz, whose analogue for the international system is a market [sic] in which balances of power automatically equilibrate relations among functionally equivalent units (see waltz 1979). 11 see especially the contributions on transnational or international regimes in the journal, international organization. 12 i am well aware that most foucauldians follow foucault in writing about govern-mentality and governmentalization. but the anglophone concept of governance in industrial economics and political science is often translated into french as 'gouvernment'; in addition, there are important parallels between the ways in which foucauldians and non-foucauldians deploy these terms. 13 'police', 'policey' or polizei concern the governance of conduct in ways that will enable those in charge of 'affairs of state' to produce an orderly 'state of affairs' in a given state's territory. this is an issue much debated in early doctrines of statecraft and discussed more recently in foucault's work on governmentality. 14 for a recent and significant account of the narrativity of social order, see somers 1994.","hay c., macleod g., painter j., peck j., rhodes r., stoker g., sum n.l., teubner g., tickell a., urry j., willke h.;

it is important to distinguish the different forms because they imply different resources, support and obligations. more research needs to be conducted into the different forms of social capital and their effects on health. a special focus should be placed on the health impacts of cross-cutting or bridging and linking forms of social capital. copyright Â© 2007 nordic sociological association and sage.",,,"berg m., putnam's social capital theory goes east: a case study of western ukraine and l'viv, europe-asia studies, 52, (2000); almedom a.m., social capital and mental health: an interdisciplinary review of primary evidence, social science and medicine, 61, (2005); baum f., ziersch a., social capital glossary, journal of epidemiology and community health, 57, (2003); berkman l., syme s.l., social networks, host resistance and mortality: a nine-year follow-up study of alameda county residents, american journal of epidemiology, 109, (1979); berkman l., leo summers l., horwots r.i., emotional support and survival after myocardial infarction: a prospective, population-based study of the elderly, psychosomatic medicine, 58, (1992); berkman l., glass t., brissette t., seeman t.e., from social integration to health: durkheim in the new millennium, social science and medicine, 51, (2000); blanchard a., horan t., virtual communities and social capital, social science computer review, 16, (1998); bourdieu p., the forms of capital, handbook for theory and research for the sociology of education, (1985); briggs x.s., brown kids in white suburbs: housing mobility and the many faces of social capital, housing policy debate, 9, (1998); brown g., harris t., social origins of depression. a study of psychiatric disorder in women, (1978); campbell c., wood r., social capital and health, (1999); cattell v., poor people, poor places, and poor health: the mediating role of social networks and social capital, social science and medicine, 52, (2001); cobb s., social support as a moderator of life stress, psychosomatic medicine, 38, (1976); cohen s., wills t.a., stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis, psychological bulletin, 98, (1985); cohen s., doyle w.j., skoner d.p., rabin b.s., gwaltney j.m., social ties and susceptibility to the common cold, journal of american medical association, 277, (1997); coleman j., social capital in the creation of human capital, american journal of sociology., (1988); coleman j., foundations of social theory, (1990); due p., holstein b., lund r., modvig j., avlund k., social relations: network, support and relational strain, social science and medicine, 48, (1999); durkheim e., suicide: a study in sociology, (1897); erickson b., social networks: the value of variety, contexts, 2, (2003); ferlander s., the internet, social capital and local community, (2003); ferlander s., researching widening access to lifelong learning: issues and approaches in an international context, elearning, marginalised communities and social capital: a mixed method approach, (2004); ferlander s., timms d., local nets and social capital, telematics and informatics, 18, (2001); field j., social capital, (2003); fratiglioni l., wang h.-x., ericsson k., maytan m., winbland b., influence of social network on occurrence of dementia: a community-based longitudinal study, the lancet, 355, (2000); fukuyama f., trust: the social virtues and the creation of prosperity, (1995); gittel r., vidal a.c., community organizing: building social capital as a development strategy, (1998); glass t., maddox g.l., the quality and quantity of social support: stroke recovery as psycho-social transition, social science and medicine, 34, (1992); granovetter m.s., the strength of weak ties, american journal of sociology, 78, (1973); hawe p., shiell a., social capital and health promotion: a review, social science and medicine, 32, (2000); house j.s., landis k.r., umberson d., social relationships and health, science, 241, (1988); hyypp m.t., mki j., individual-level relationships between social capital and self-rated health in bilingual community, preventive medicine, 32, (2001); idler e.l., benjamini y., self-rated health and mortality. a review of twenty-seven community studies, journal of health and social behaviour, 38, (1997); islam m.k., merlo j., kawachi i., lindstrom m., gerdtham u.-g., social capital and health: does egalitarianism matter?
